# simple-gravitational-pendulum
this is a python script to calculate the period of simple gravitational pendulum in different amplitude (in degrees)
run the main.py
and input the angle you prefer( from 0 to 180 degrees)
and you would get the ratio of period on T = 2*pi*(L/g)**(0.5)

Have fun and do more changes!
